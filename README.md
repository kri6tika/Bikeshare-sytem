# Bikeshare-sytem
Created a user friendly interactive environment, and analysed the Bikeshare system of three major cities in the United States- Chicago, New york and Washington. Here a user could filter out his/her required information 
Eg. When do most people in Chicago use this bikeshare system by month, day or hour? In New york, what is the average age of a biker using this system ?Do women in New york also use this system? If yes, who forms the majority men or women? What is the most used route in Washington?
